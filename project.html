 Back in 2001, when I was 13.5 years young,my family bought a <mark> 56k modem </mark>.My parents would only allow me to use the web 1 hour a week,
so I saved up my allowance,bought a 150' phone cable,drilled a couple 1" holes in the wood floor while my parents were out,and army-crawled under the house to rout the phone
cable to my room.I pieced back together a crappy old <mark>IBM Thinkpad 600</mark> and would tiptoe at night to the office to switch the 56k modem over to my rooms cable-hack to
play<mark>Age of EmpiresI</mark> online for hours on end,sometimes till dawn.</p>
<br/>
<p> 6 years later,during my Freshmen year at <mark>SDSU</mark>, I received a phone call from my father about some strange holes he discovered in the wood floor while
my bparents were selling the house.Needless to say,at the time he wasnt <mark>thrilled</mark> at how stunningly creative I had been in circumventing their moratorium
on the internet,however in retrospect I now realize drilling those holes in the floor was one of the best things I ever did as it was in that moment I fell in love with computers.</p>
<br/>
<p> currently <mark> I help make the internet faster </mark>. On my free-time I help motivate others to learn to code through my own experiences.I get stoked on creative people and life altering ideas.</p>
